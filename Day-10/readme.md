Learned on Day 10:

    -How to deploy our app on AWS/or any of the cloud computing platform.


Cloud Computing/Cloud platforms:

    -Servers: Our own computers and laptops can be servers too, but kaafi weak pad jayenge for heavy databases and functionalities.

    -Virtual Machine: System ke andar ek different system (i.e a virtual system) ban jata hai which resides in our own system/machine but acts as a diffrent system/machine than our system/machine.

    -AWS(or any cloud computing platform) ke paas ek bada sa system hota hai, and whenever you require a system for various server-side services on cloud, they give you a part of the that bada sa system, which is a virtual machine of that system, for you to host your server on cloud(We get different memory, OS for our work-basically hamare liye ek computer bana ke de deta hai). It also gives some additional functionalities.
